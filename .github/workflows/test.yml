# Main CI for DDS Pipe repository
# This is executed:
#  - every PullRequest (new or update)
#  - every merge in main
#  - every night (05:00)
#
# These jobs that require to install eprosima libraries uses the artifact generated for eprosima-CI nightly
# so they do not have to compile the whole project. This saves huge amount of time.
#
# JOBS:
#
#   - uncrustify
#     - ubuntu-22.04
#     - test uncrustify
#
#   - python-linter
#     - ubuntu-22.04
#     - test python linter
#
# TODO: when merge CI in eprosima-CI repository, the jparisu fork must change for eProsima in actions.
# TODO: When code is already available, add new jobs
